Meal Planning and Shopping List App

## from Applause Interactive via SkillShare

This is the code from Intro to Programming Lesson on SkillShare
I have changed the code from the lesson as follows:
-Updated to print grocery list alphabetized, removed duplicated, and numbered as a list
-Updated to add while loop to run program
-Updated to allow user to ask for shopping list in case of error answer (not type y or n)
-Updated to allow user to type Y or y for yes.

I am learning how to use git and wanted to upload this code.
I have already made changes to the code, so don't need to push the new stuff but if I go back to improve the code more, I will work on the push.
